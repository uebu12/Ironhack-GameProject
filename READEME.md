# Virtual Pet

## About the game

Virtual pet is an homage of the very popular toy "Tamagotchi", released in 1996.
This is a game built in HTML, CSS and JavaScript as a part of an Ironhack project.

## So what is the story?

Much like in real life, if you don't feed the creature for to long, it will get sick and die.

## About the creator

I am a student at Ironhack.
